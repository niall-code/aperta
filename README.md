# Aperta

This React app is designed to serve as the front end of my full-stack portfolio project, Aperta.

The repository for the back end can be found here: https://github.com/niall-code/aperta-api

Aperta is a content platform, made distinct from my Moments walkthrough project by the inclusion of additional functionality, particularly security features like the ability to block another user or report an inappropriate post. As such, my main project goal was to improve on the concept previously explored by addressing the real-world issue that a platform will inevitably be misused by some people, in order for me to create a social media platform where due attention is given to minimising unpleasant interactions and removing objectionable material, so that users can enjoy and utilise the web application in a more welcoming environment.

## Design, Development, and Deployment Process

### Naming

I chose the name Aperta because it is Latin for open, suiting the nature of a platform where people share content.

### Initial Setup

I created a GitHub repository and a Gitpod workspace for it. As with the beginning of Moments, I created a React app and pre-installed dependencies by running:

`npx create-react-app . --template git+https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/cra-template-moments.git --use-npm`

As I had found previously, `npm start` was not immediately useable, generating an error message.

As before, I fixed it by running `npm install react-scripts@latest`.
